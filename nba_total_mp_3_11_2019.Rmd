## MP Data from Basketball Reference

All data was pulled from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) on March 11, 2019. Included is total minutes played for the [regular season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/mp_career.html) and the [playoffs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/mp_career_p.html) since the 1951-1952 season. Only the top 200 in both regular season and playoff total minutes were pulled.

  mutate(reg_total_mp = mp,
         seasons = (to - from) + 1) %>%
